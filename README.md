# Cybersecurity Python Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts developed to explore cybersecurity and threat detection concepts. The scripts focus on analyzing inputs, identifying suspicious patterns, and applying defensive programming techniques.

## Overview
The goal of these projects was to gain hands-on experience with cybersecurity fundamentals through scripting and logic-based analysis. The work emphasizes system awareness, pattern detection, and secure programming practices.

## Features
- Input analysis for abnormal or suspicious behavior
- Pattern detection and conditional logic for threat identification
- Defensive programming techniques
- Exposure to endpoint security and monitoring concepts

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Concepts Applied
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- Threat detection logic
- Secure coding practices
- System and endpoint security awareness

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run a script using:
   python PaytonCyber.py
   or
   python PaytonCyber2.py
